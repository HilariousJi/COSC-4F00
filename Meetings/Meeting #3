  - Database
  - Submission
  
Summary of meeting:
  Finalize rough draft of the template -
    - Software requirement specification document rough draft pretty much complete.
    - Create another new final draft of template to show progress.
    - Start to convert rough draft to final draft.
    
  Create hard-copy sketches of the system to gain feedback -
    - Juan has created sketches of potential system UI.
    - Can use sketches to receive feedback from teachers/potential users.
    - This can be very useful before implementation in case of design changes.
    
  UML -
    - Ask other professors for "better" UML options. Robson?
  
  System and algorithm plan -
    - System features
        - Script/Button submission? Both?
        - Allow gradient selection. % plagiarized, include comments and disclude folder.
    - Putty vs Browser
    - Handle browser return documents.
    
  Database - 
    - Need 3 tables - Account, course, ID.
    - Access to database for student-course-teacher.
    - Can use database for scrubbing.
     
  Submission -
    - Ability to overwrite past documents. Only 1 submission.
    - At the time of submission, copy all current files in the storage and send to teacher server.
    - No submission means blank document (no document?).
        - May need to solve multiple blanks being flagged as 100% plagiarized.
    
Meeting conclusion:
  - Final draft of software requirement specification document started.
  - Use Juan's designs and obtain feedback.
  - Look for potential UML software.
  - More implementation of system including submission ideas, more teacher controls and file handling.
  - Database and submission specifics finalized.

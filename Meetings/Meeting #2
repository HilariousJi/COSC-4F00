Meeting #2 - 2:00pm. Jan 16, 2019. 

Absent - Jesse due to work and Ji due to workshop.

Goals of the meeting:
  - Make sure rough work template is on the right track.
  - Any updates or changes that we need to apply to the template.
  - Create use cases and UML diagrams for the template.
  - Idea implementation and design.
  
Summary of meeting:
  Rough work template on the right track -
    - Template is almost complete.
    - Almost at the final stage to convert into sentences.
    
  Updates or changes that we need to apply to the template -
    - Add more description to sections.
    - Focus more on our idea implementation.
    
  Create use cases and UML diagrams for the template:
    - Finding a software to design UML diagrams. Something used in HCI(COSC3P94)?
    - Should be done by February 1, 2019.
    - Find more use cases
  
  Idea implementation and design:
    - Create hard copy of sketches of our interface and system.
    - We can show our design implementation to teachers to receive feedback.
    - Learn from MOSS mistakes or design flaws and create something more useful.
        ***Actual MOSS can be downloaded online and used to show design and implementation
        - How does it compare to ours?
        - How can we improve on it?
    - Handle database at their respective schools to store all relevant information.
    
Meeting conclusion:
  - Template is on track with our deadline. May need a bit of expanding and tweaking in certain sections.
  - Create hard copy of sketches on how we plan to implement the project. Can be used to get feedback.
  - Next meeting should focus on creating a rough draft of how our system should look like.
  - Find applications to make UML.
- The rough draft template should be done for the next meeting.
